The tsv output file is a matrix where each row represent a DNA sequence and the columns are as fallows:
1. ID of the subject hit (or '*' if no hit was found)
2. Percentage identity
3. Alignment score
4. Query string
5. Subject string
6. Number of aligments for this read
7. Number of soft clipped bases to the left
8. Number of matched bases
9. Number of soft clipped bases to the right



As well as the standard Sam flags 
10.  Read paired (1 = read is paired, 0 = read is NOT pair)
11.  Read mapped in proper pair (1 = read is mapped in proper pair, 0 = read is NOT mapped in proper pair)
12.  Read unmapped (1 = read is NOT mapped, 0 = read is mapped)
13.  Mate unmapped (1 = mate read is NOT mapped, 0 = mate read is mapped)
14.  Read reverse strand (1 = read is in the reverse strand, 0 = read is in the forward)
15.  Mate reverse strand (1 = mate is in the reverse strand, 0 = mate is in the forward)
16.  First in pair  (1 = read is first in pair, 0 = read is not first in pair)
17. Second in pair (1 = read is second in pair, 0 = read is not second in pair, if read is singe end, it's neither first nor second)
18. Not primary alignment (1 = this is a secondary aligment, 0= this a primary aligment)
19. Read fails platform/vendor quality checks
20. Read is PCR or optical duplicate
21. Supplementary alignment
